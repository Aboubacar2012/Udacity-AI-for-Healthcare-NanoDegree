    "In Exercice1, we experimented with some smoothing with Otsu's method for some basic image preprocessing. There other types of images pre-processing that become important when we start using deep learning. While pre-processing is classifically thougth of as being useful for cleaning up images by removing artifacts and smouthing out noice, there's another purpose for pre-processing that's more specific to deep learing. That purpose is to expand our set of real images that you have selected for training and creates augmented copies of them to make the set larger, but also to expand the range and variety of the training data that your model will see. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercice, you'll use keras' built-in ImageDataGenerator class to perform augmentation on a set of mammography images to transform those images into a wider variety of appearances for training a future model. Note that there is an infinite number of ways that you augmente an image, and the ways in which you do this should reflect what's possible to see in the real world."
